## Summary 

Team Slam Dunk (Aaron Chen, Alejandro Montesinos, Christian De Vera and Zane Brown) invited the audience to imagine themselves as analytics consultants for an NBA team determined to win the championship. What recommendations should you make to the GM and why? Which factors contribute to winning? 

Zane started things off by demonstrating that although the shooting efficiency of NBA teams hasn’t changed much in the last five years coaching philosophy sure has evolved. Teams have finally come to realize that making 36% of three point shots yields more points (1.08)  than 50% of two pointers (1.00). Teams that shoot more from long range win more games. The efficiency of 3 point shooting has accounted for 34% of the variance in team wins over the last 5 years.

Christian proved that the mid range shot (10-23 feet) is the least efficient shot in basketball.
This new approach to offense, where teams shoot more 3s, avoid mid range shots, and rely on analytics has been dubbed as “Moreyball”, named after the Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey. The more mid-range shots a team attempts, the lowers its effective field goal percentage. The lower a team’s effective field goal percentage, the lower the offensive efficiency. The lower the offensive efficiency, the fewer games it wins.

Aaron shifted the focus from offense to defense. The common belief is that “defense wins championships”. But in today’s NBA is that still true?  Even though average defensive stats (such as steals, blocked shots, defensive rebounds) are increasing due to faster pace, they do not necessarily help a team win games. However, defensive efficiency is found to go hand in hand in a team winning games. Allow fewer points per possession and you win more games.

Alejandro performed factor analysis, breaking down the stats for a measure that captures the level of team performance scientifically. Principal Component Analysis is  a statistical technique for dimension reduction. In his model,  positive factors included 3-pointers, free throws and assists. Negative components consisted of missed shots, turnovers and fouls.  All stats are measured in per 100 possession to adjust for team's pace. He concluded that on the offensive side field goal percentage (both for two and three pointers)  and assists are what matters. Conversely on the defensive side forcing your opponents to miss shots has the highest explanatory power. Alejandro’s Team Performance Index (TPI) accounts for more than half of the variance in wins per season.

In doing our analysis Team Slam Dunk relied on statistics from two sources: Basketball Reference & NBA.com. After merging the data on the key “team name” we performed string manipulation to “clean” the information. We then selected pertinent factors for analysis.

Given enough time it would be interesting to delve into play-by-play data to answer other interesting questions. Can great coaches outperform their talent over the long run? Do certain player combos on a team have “chemistry” that enables a team to do well when they play together? Will advance metrics such as PIE and assist/turnover ratio contribute to winning? Do teams with multiple superstars do better than teams with one leader and several “role players”. Stay tuned!
